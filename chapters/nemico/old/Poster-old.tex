% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Thanks to the rapid advances in applications and services based on Internet, data acquisition and storage technologies, petabyte-sized network data collections, are becoming more and more common, prompting the need for scalable data analysis solutions. By leveraging today's ubiquitous many-core computer architectures and the increasingly popular cloud computing paradigm, the applicability of data mining algorithms on these large volumes of network data can be dramatically scaled up to gain interesting insights.


This paper proposes a comprensive system, named \Nemico , designed to digging deep into data network data for targeted
traffic flow analysis (e.g., characterization of traffic flows, identification of interesting correlations at a different level of abstraction, detect anomalies). 
\Nemico\ include new approaches that contribute to a paradigm-shift in distributed data mining, by addressing issues raised by the characteristics of Big Data such as data sparsity, horizontal scaling, and parallel computation.

An important issue in network traffic analysis is to profile communications, detect anomalies or security threats, and identify recurrent patterns.  To these aims, the analysis could be performed on: (i) Packet payloads, (ii) traffic metrics, and (iii) statistical features computed on traffic flows. A significant research effort has been devoted to the application of data mining techniques to network traffic
analysis. The proposed approaches include
studying correlations among data~\cite{NostroComNet,AnomalyOverview07}, extracting
information for prediction~\cite{KaragiannisPF05}, grouping network data with similar
properties~\cite{Erman05}.
However, due to the continuous growth in network speed, peta-bytes of data may be transferred through a network every day. 
These ''big data'' collections stress the limits of existing data mining techniques and sets new horizons for the design of innovative techniques to address data analysis.

The challenge of our work is to design and develop a comprensive system able to offer a variety of network analytics services to cloud users. 
More specifically, this paper presents the \Nemico\ system to efficiently discover different kinds of interesting knowledge by means of a distributed computing model.
\Nemico\ consists of a series of distributed MapReduce jobs run in the cloud. Each job performs a different step in the knowledge discovery process ranging from the network data acquisition to knowledge exploitation. 

%****************************************************
\section{The \Nemico\ architecture}
\label{arch}
%****************************************************
The building blocks of the \Nemico\ architecture are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}. To effectively support analysts in discovering different and interesting kinds of knowledge, a broad variety of data mining algorithms will be integrated in the system such as exploratory techiques (e.g., association rules, clustering) and prediction ones (e.g., classification and regression algorithms). 

The \Nemico\ implementation consists of a series of distributed jobs run in the cloud to cover the overall process of discovering useful knowledge from network data. Each job
receives as input the result of one or more preceding jobs and performs one of the
steps required for mining network data.
Currently, each job is performed by one or more MapReduce tasks run on a
Hadoop cluster.

%****************************************************
\subsection{Data acquisition}
\label{Netacq}
%****************************************************

\Nemico\ acquires massive amounts of network traffic measurements through passive traffic sniffing.
A passive probe located on the Internet access link of an edge network is exploited to acquire incoming and outgoing packets flowing on the link.
Traffic monitoring is performed by Tstat~\cite{Tstat}, a tool that allows users to collect network and transport layer measurements. 
Tstat rebuilds TCP connections by matching sequence numbers on data segments with the corresponding acknowledgement (ACK) numbers.
The acquired datasets consist of a set of records, each one corresponding to a different TCP flow.
To ensure measurement reliability, only the TCP flows that last more than ten packets (i.e., the long-lived flows) are considered.

\Nemico\ stores the collected network traffic data in an HDFS distributed file
system.  It can successfully acquire and handle all the network measurements provided by Tstat. Among others, the supported measurements comprise (i) the Round-Trip-Time (RTT) observed on a TCP flow, which indicates the minimum time lag between the observation of a TCP segment and the 
observation of the corresponding ACK, (ii) the TCP port of the server, (iii) the number of packets, and (iv) the class of application layer service (e.g., HTTP,VIDEO) assigned by Tstat.
Note that Tstat measurements comprise both continuous values (e.g., the RTT) and discrete values (e.g., the class of service).  

%****************************************************
\subsection{Data preparation}
\label{dataprep}
%****************************************************

To suit the raw data to the subsequent data mining step some established data preprocessing steps are applied to the raw network traffic measurements. 
A brief description of the main data preparation steps is given below.

\textbf{Discretization}. Discretization concerns the transformation of continuous values into discrete ones. Since some data mining algorithms are unable to cope with continuously valued data, measurement values are discretized prior to running the algorithms. 
In some cases (e.g., the association rule mining algorithms) discretization is not mandatory but strongly recommended because considering continuously valued attributes could bias the mining result (e.g., the association rules extracted from continuously valued attributes are unlikely to occur frequently in the source data). The discretization step can be performed either automatically (by using established techniques~\cite{libroKumar}) or semi-automatically (by partitioning continuous value ranges into appropriate bins based on the prior knowledge about the measurement domains). Due to the nature of the analyzed network data, manual data discretization is often preferable.  

\textbf{Data conversion}. Since most algorithms are designed to handle only a subset of specific data formats, data conversion entails the transformation of the raw data into the expected data format. For example, most association rule mining algorithms are designed to cope with transactional data~\cite{libroKumar}. Hence, to successfully apply association rule mining algorithms the acquired data have to be tailored to the transactional data format. 


\textbf{Labelling}. Supervised data mining techniques (e.g., classification) require the labelling of one or more data attributes 
as classes to drive the prediction process. Hence, if the subsequent data mining process comprises supervised analyses experts have to label one or more network measurements as reference classes. 

\textbf{Taxonomy generation}. The mining process for extracting more abstract and interesting correlations among data (e.g., generalized association rules) is driven by taxonomies. A taxonomy is a hierarchy of aggregations over values of one attribute (e.g., TCP port) and it is usually represented as a tree. \Nemico\ allows either to automatically infer interesting taxonomies directly from the data. To this aim different algorithms have been devised and implemented to automatically extract taxonomies for the considered attributes (i.e., port number, packet number) since some attributes (e.g., port number) are actually hierarchical attributes while others are numerical ones.In \Nemico\ taxonomies could also be provided directly by the user.

The current implementation of \Nemico\ includes the implementation of both data discretization and conversion which are performed by a single map only job. Each record is processed by the map
function and, if the number of packets is above the threshold (e.g., 10?? packets), the corresponding discretized version is generated as output of the mapping step.
This task entails an inherently parallel elaboration, considering that can be applied independently to each record.



%****************************************************
\subsection{Knowledge extraction}
\label{KnowExt}
%****************************************************
The knowledge extraction block of \Nemico\ focuses on data mining algorithms to find implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from large volume of network data. \Nemico\ includes novel data mining algorithms that contribute to a paradigm-shift in distributed data mining. The analytics algorithms support studying correlations among data (e.g., association rules at different levels of abstraction), grouping data with similar properties (e.g., clustering), and extracting interesting knowledge for prediction (e.g., classification, regression).  The design of these new approaches addresses the following open issues.

\textit{Sparse data distribution.} Since Big data collections have large
cardinality and/or high-dimensional data, they are usually characterized by an
inherent sparseness and variable distribution. Aimed at addressing these issues, we propose incremental algorithms that are able to cope with result refinement over different incremental runs and that scale by adapting to new data without the need to re-analyze the entire dataset.

\textit{Algorithm optimization}. Available large-scale data mining algorithms are poorly optimized for cloud computing environments. Hence, our algorithm have been designed to improve the scalability of the existing techniques and their performance in massively parallel computing environments.

\textit{Horizontal scalability.} To apply the mining techniques to petabyte-scale datasets, such as network traffic, we integrated into \Nemico\ advanced analytics algorithms (e.g., association rule mining) with horizontally scalable approaches, such as those based on Map Reduce and shared columnar storage backends.

The current implementation of \Nemico\ includes Hadoop-based data mining algorithms that enable the extraction of interesting correlations among network data at a different level of abstractions (i.e, association rule mining \cite{ISPA13} and 
misleading multiple-level patterns \cite{ISPA14}). 

%**********************************************************
\subsection{Knowledge categorization and selection}
\label{KnowCatSel}
%**********************************************************
Explorative data mining approaches, such as association rule mining and clustering algorithms, may identify interesting knowledge, which may be both huge in size and complex in structure. To ease exploitation of the mined knowledge, different
interestingness measures (e.g., chi square, support expectation, collective strength) to reduce and evaluate the amount of extracted knowledge  are  needed. For a detailed review on measures for interesting rules and quality indexes for clustering see \cite{Hilderman2001} and  \cite{KumarBook} respectively. The current implementation of \Nemico\ includes COSA METTIAMO??

Furthermore, only for the discovery of correlations when coping with relatively
large or complex transactional network datasets the number of mined rules could be
so large that a manual inspection becomes unfeasible. To overcome this issue, \Nemico\ propose a classification of the rules into
groups according to their semantics in the network domain. 

%**********************************************************
\section{Preliminary experiments}
\label{exp}
%**********************************************************
The current implementation of \Nemico\ has been validated on real network traffic datasets obtained by performing different
capture stages on a backbone link of a nation-wide ISP in Italy that offers us three different vantage points.
The dataset has size 192.56 GB and it consists of 413,012,989 records, i.e., one record for each bi-directional TCP flow).

The MapReduce jobs of the \Nemico\ were
developed in Java using the new Hadoop Java APIs.
The experiments were performed on a cluster of 5 nodes running Cloudera's
Distribution of Apache Hadoop (CDH4.5). Each cluster node is a 2.67~GHz
six-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) X5650 machine with 32~Gbyte of main memory running
Ubuntu 12.04 server with the 3.5.0-23-generic kernel. All the reported
execution times are real times obtained from the Cloudera Manager web control panel.

We evaluated the scalability of the proposed architecture by measuring the speedup achieved increasing the number of Hadoop cluster nodes.
Specifically, we considered three configurations: 1 node, 3 nodes, and 5 nodes.

% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.

% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells

%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.


% conference papers do not normally have an appendix


% use section* for acknowledgement
